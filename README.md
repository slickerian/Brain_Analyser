Simple Brain CT scan analyser website that can detect the presence of Alzheimers in the patient brain. Done in streamlit, its a very simple website. Not completely developed like the meditron AI and the firebase credentials support. Will update them in the future when we get time.
This was a test website that we developed as a part of learning how machine learning models work. The model was a pre trained model we got from Kaggle. Remember to create a venv environment and install necessary libraries inside it. Streamlit doesnt support otherwise. Feel free to educate me on the cons of this project. Thanks!!
